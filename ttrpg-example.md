**Genre:** Fantasy Adventure

---

#### **Premise**
The world of Elaris has been broken into floating realms after a cataclysmic event known as "The Shattering." Each realm now drifts in the void, connected by dangerous sky bridges, hidden portals, or tamed sky-beasts. Players take on the roles of adventurers exploring these realms, uncovering ancient secrets, fighting sky-beasts, and restoring balance.

### **Character Creation**
**Step 1: Choose a Class**
- **Skyknight**: Mounted on a flying beast, you specialize in aerial combat and defense.
- **Runeseeker**: You harness the ancient magic of the realms to manipulate the environment.
- **Realmwalker**: Master of stealth and travel, you can slip between realms with ease.
- **Forgeheart**: Strong and hardy, you craft powerful weapons and armor from the remnants of the old world.
- **Wildshaper**: You control the natural forces of the shattered realms and can transform into beasts.

**Step 2: Assign Attributes**
You have 10 points to divide among **three attributes** (max 5 in any):
- **Might**: Strength, combat prowess, physical actions.
- **Wits**: Magic, intelligence, problem-solving.
- **Grace**: Agility, stealth, reflexes.

**Step 3: Choose an Equipment**
- A special weapon (e.g., enchanted sword, bow with tracking arrows).
- A tool or device (e.g., grappling hook, rune stone).
- A mount or familiar (e.g., sky-beast, small elemental companion).

### **Mechanics**
#### **Core Mechanic**
When attempting any action, roll a 6-sided die (1d6). Add the relevant attribute (Might, Wits, or Grace). Compare the result to the Difficulty Target (DT) of the task:

- **DT 4**: Easy task
- **DT 6**: Normal task
- **DT 8**: Hard task
- **DT 10**: Very hard task

**Success**: If your roll meets or exceeds the DT, you succeed. If not, you fail and face a consequence.

#### **Combat**
- Each player takes turns attacking. Roll a 1d6 + Might (for melee) or 1d6 + Grace (for ranged).
- If your result is higher than the opponent’s defense (usually a DT 6), you hit and deal damage. Most enemies have **3 health**.
- You have **5 health**. If you hit 0 health, you’re knocked unconscious.

#### **Magic and Special Abilities**
- Using magic or abilities consumes a resource called **Focus**. You start with 3 Focus and can regain it by resting.
- Spend 1 Focus to roll with advantage (roll two dice and pick the highest).
- **Runeseekers** and **Wildshapers** can spend 1 Focus to use a spell or transformation ability.

### **Adventure Framework**
#### **Exploring the Realms**
- The GM (Game Master) describes the shattered realms, each floating island with unique biomes, sky-pirate ships, or ruins.
- Players must cross dangerous terrain or solve puzzles to reach hidden areas.

#### **Sample Encounters**
1. **Sky-Beast Ambush**: A fierce wind dragon attacks the party while they cross a sky bridge. They must either fight it or find a way to outrun it.
2. **Ancient Rune Puzzle**: A sealed gateway needs to be opened by solving a rune-based puzzle. A failure might activate a trap.
3. **Pirate Raid**: Sky pirates board the players' ship mid-flight. Players must repel the attackers or negotiate for safe passage.

#### **Goals**
- **Recover Lost Artifacts**: Hidden throughout the shattered realms are ancient artifacts that can help restore balance. The players' goal is to find these and either reforge the world or seize power for themselves.
- **Defeat a Realm Tyrant**: One of the floating realms is ruled by a tyrant who seeks to control all the fragments. The players must defeat them to prevent total domination.

### **Advancement**
After completing major milestones (defeating enemies, solving puzzles, etc.), players can:
- Gain 1 more point to distribute to their attributes (max 6).
- Learn a new ability related to their class.
- Recover all lost Focus and health.
